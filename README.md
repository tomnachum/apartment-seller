## Design

In this project we used Handlebars to create separation of concerns with the JS code and the HTML code.
Until this point, when we added HTML code dynamically, we wrote it inside our JS files, this is bad because we are getting a mix of languages, and we lose the point of keeping the js for logic, and the html for template.
